        <p>
          "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton
          devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is
          a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its
          initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game
          of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it
          evolves."
